# inetRadioFavs (Internet Radio Favourites)

This software can be used to stream internet-radio-stations.
The focus is based on saving songs you like in a list and to search further information to this song.

The software doesn't support access to a radio-station-database (yet).
But your favourite radio-stations can be saved using the gui.
